Requirements: numpy tqdm pygame

Installing these packages should be as simple as opening command prompt and typing

pip install [package name]

If you know what it is I recommend using a virtual environment but if you don't that's fine this command works anyway. If it doesn't work then ask me about it.

Please rename and submit YOURNAMESPlayer.py.  main.py can be modified for testing purposes. You shouldn't have to modify any other files to work with the code and I will not be using any modifications you make elsewhere. Feel free to look around if you want.

Here's the step-by-step version if you have simple IDLE in Windows:

    Open the Start Menu and type Command Prompt - before you finish it, the program should appear as the Command Prompt desktop app.
    Right-click the Command Prompt program and choose Run as administrator.
    If it asks if it can make changes, select Yes.
    Type:

py -3 -m pip install --upgrade pip

    Then type:

py -3 -m pip install numpy

py -3 -m pip install tqdm

py -3 -m pip install pygame

    Click on the green Code button on the GitHub page
    Choose Download ZIP
    Extract the resulting downloaded file somewhere on your computer.
    Inside the folder, right-click Main.py and choose Edit with IDLE.
